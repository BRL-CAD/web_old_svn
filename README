BRL-CAD is a powerful Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) solid modeling
system. BRL-CAD includes an interactive geometry editor, ray tracing
support for rendering and geometric analysis, network distributed
framebuffer support, image-processing and signal-processing tools. The
entire package is distributed in source code and binary form.

This is the website for BRL-CAD.

The website is maintained separately from BRL-CAD as a separate
installation module.  The primarly intent of the website module is to
provide web developers with an isolated location for the website
sourcecode to live version-controlled.


INSTALLATION

At most, it should be sufficient to point a web root url to the
htdocs/ directory.  There should be no preprocessing or preparation of
the website sourcecode for it to be used, as long as the required web
server components are installed.  The primary BRL-CAD website will
automatically update to the version stored within this module
periodically (nightly).

Presently, the sole requirement for install is PHP 4 and a capable web
server such as Apache.

Scripts to install the website in a SourceForge-similar arrangement
are included in the misc/ directory.  This includes a cron job and a
run script.  Installation is described in more detail in the INSTALL
file.
