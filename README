                       BRL-CAD Website

BRL-CAD is a powerful Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) solid modeling
system. BRL-CAD includes an interactive geometry editor, ray tracing
support for rendering and geometric analysis, network distributed
framebuffer support, image-processing and signal-processing tools. The
entire package is distributed in source code and binary form.

This is the website for BRL-CAD.

The website is maintained separately from BRL-CAD as a separate
installation module.  The primarly intent of the website module is to
provide web developers with an isolated location for the website
sourcecode to live version-controlled.

See the NEWS file for more details on the latest events regarding the
BRL-CAD website.


Installation
============

Assuming that there is a web server installed already, and that php is
properly configured, it should be sufficient to point a web root url
to the htdocs/ directory and import an SQL file/edit an SQL configuration 
file to get the website up and running.  There should be no 
preprocessing or preparation of the website sourcecode necessary for it to 
be useable other than configuration files.  The primary BRL-CAD website 
should automatically be updating to the latest version stored within this
module on a daily basis.

Presently, the requirements for install are PHP >=5.3.2, a capable web
server such as Apache, and MySQL >=5.0.2 (Other SQL servers may work.

Scripts to install the website in a SourceForge-similar arrangement
may be included at a later date in the misc/ directory.  This includes a 
cron job and an install script.
