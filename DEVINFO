The website is mainly written in php using a template-driven design to
encourage separation of site organization and logic from the
presentation and style.  The template system is a customized caching
class that does not require any special syntax in the templates
themselves, i.e. the templates themselves are just php.  For the most
part, beyond basic site frameworking and accounting, the style and
appearance are driven by css stylesheets.

php code should be well documented.

classes/objects should be used for logic instead of functions.

indent php and html, 2 space indent with tab stops at 8 characters.
