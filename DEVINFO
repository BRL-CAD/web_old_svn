Coding Conventions
------------------

Please adhere to the following conventions when working on the BRL-CAD
website sources.  If you plan on contributing to the website, we would
like you to follow certain guidelines so that some degree of
consistency and familiarity is achieved.  Contributions that don't
conform are likely to be ridiculed and rejected until they do.

PHP files should use the '.php' extension.  Files used in PHP as
include/require files should use the '.inc' extension.  Hypertext
files not containing logic may be named as either '.php' or '.html'.

Filenames should be lowercase for all files that will be visible as
part of a URL.  Include files containing a class should be named
according to the class name (e.g. class WebSite could be named
"WebSite.inc").

As all images are visible as part of a URL, they should be named in
all lowercase as well.  Images should be in either jpeg, gif, or png
format.

There should generally be no more than one class per file.  There are
exceptions to this rule, for example if there is a utility class that
is private to a particular implementation.  In general, however, if
the class is going to be used in another file, it's preferred to
separate it out into another file by itself.

Any logic code should be well documented.  All classes should
minimally contain documentation on what the expected interface is, as
well as what the public functions are.
